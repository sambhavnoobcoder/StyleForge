## Note:

- this is a deterministic model, so it can potentially generate different outputs for the same prompts . try this to generate more items matching the same description.

- the model is a highly resource-expensive model requiring GPU for good inference. Since the hosted inference is actually CPU,  it can take more time than expected to run the prompts . kindly wait patiently for the generation interval of the prompt.
